Building data visuals and apps using sports data. Here is the list of my projects:

1. xGApp - Shiny app that lets the user pick a Premier League team and get a graph of that team's xG difference during their league games for the 2024/2025 season.

2. ShotMap - Simple football shot chart for the Liverpool v Arsenal match. Change the match by pasting the understat url of any game into the code.
